      <h3>The Biggest Threat to Innovation of Our Time</h3>
      <p>Although this video is not featured in my editing reel, I played a significant role in the editing process. It
        is a miniature documentary on Microsoftâ€™s role in mass monopolization that was written, directed, and designed
        by Greg Dizzia and released on July 24, 2020. Using assets he created, I was able to help bring his creative
        vision to life through keyframe animation, creative sound design, and well-timed cuts and edits to musical hits.
